			<h2>Award-Winning Italian Cuisine Served Since 1985</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to Luigi's Trattoria, downtown Chicago's premier
				destination for authentic Italian dining. For over 35 years, our
				family-owned restaurant has been crafting traditional Italian
				dishes using recipes passed down through three generations.
				Located in the heart of Chicago's Loop district at 123 State
				Street, we specialize in handmade pasta, wood-fired Neapolitan
				pizza, and classic Italian entrees prepared with imported
				ingredients from Italy.

				Whether you're planning a romantic dinner, family celebration,
				business lunch, or special occasion, Luigi's Trattoria offers an
				intimate atmosphere paired with exceptional service. Our
				experienced chefs use only the finest San Marzano tomatoes,
				extra virgin olive oil from Tuscany, and aged
				Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese to create memorable dining
				experiences that transport you straight to Italy.
